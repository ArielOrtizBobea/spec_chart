# spec_chart
Generate a specification chart in base R (with reproducible example)

This function allows you to create a "specification chart" using base R code. This allows the researcher to concisely showcase a series of estimates from a wide range of models. This is useful when conducting sensitivity analysis.

The code includes a reproducible example conducting a sensitivity analysis of the analysis done in Harrison and Rubinfeld (JEEM, 1978).
